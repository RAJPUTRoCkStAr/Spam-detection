                The word cloud below visualizes the most frequently occurring words in messages categorized as "ham" (non-spam). Each word's size in the cloud is proportional to its frequency in the dataset. This visualization offers a quick and intuitive overview of common themes, communication patterns, and frequently used words within the non-spam messages.

                ### Key Insights:
                - **Frequent Terms:** Larger and bolder words represent those that appear most often in the "ham" messages.
                - **Content Overview:** The word cloud provides a snapshot of the common topics and subjects found in non-spam communication.
                - **Communication Patterns:** Explore the language and phrases commonly used in regular messages.

                This visualization serves as an exploratory tool for understanding the textual content of "ham" messages at a glance.

                The bar chart below illustrates the distribution of messages in the dataset across different classes, specifically "Ham" (non-spam) and "Spam". Each bar represents the count of messages in the respective category.

                ### Key Insights:
                - **Ham Messages:** The number of messages categorized as "Ham" is represented by the first bar.
                - **Spam Messages:** The second bar represents the count of messages categorized as "Spam".

                This visualization provides a quick overview of the class distribution, allowing us to understand the balance or imbalance between non-spam and spam messages in the dataset.

                ### Class Counts:
                - **Ham Messages Count:** {Count_HAM}
                - **Spam Messages Count:** {Count_SPAM}

                Explore the chart to gain insights into the relative abundance of each class in the dataset.
